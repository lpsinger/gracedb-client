Note that the dependencies for the python3-ligo-gracedb package is somewhat
different from the python-ligo-gracedb package because python3-m2crypto and
python3-cjson do not exist. However, some basic functions of gracedb doesn't
need them. Consider making them recommended rather than required dependencies.
